# Be a Reg-Expert

Imagine that you're a coder that is creating an application that has to parse randomly sourced data and user input, and that your application needs to have the ability to recognize specific patterns. How would you accomplish such functionality? Furthermore, imagine that your application needs to be able to validate the incoming data to be sure that it's in the expected format and doesn't contain any malicious data. How do we validate data format? Lastly, imagine that your application also needs to be able to find and replace certain words, characters, or phrases in a stream of data. Is it possible that there is a single tool that could handle all three of these examples? You bet there is! Regular expressions (generally referred to as regex) are a very powerful tool that can make data parsing much easier and more efficient. Let's learn how regex works and see some examples of what it can do.

## Summary

In this tutorial we will be using a common regular expression (regex) that is used to identify whether a string is a URL or not. We will be learning regex by breaking down the example regex into it's different parts and explaining exactly how each section functions independently, and how it works in tandum with the other parts of the expression. Here is our example:

"/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/"
